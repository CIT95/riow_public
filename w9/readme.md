# My Python App

## How to setup and run my code

1. Clone my public repo into your local system. 

2.  Create a new virtual environment inside the directory
    <code>python3 -m venv dirname</code>
3. add .gitignore <br>in the dirname and place * in that file to not have any of the files tracked int his folder    
4. Activate virtual enivornment</br>
>> Mac and Linux </br>
    <code>source dirname/bin/activate </code>      
>> Windows </br>
    <code>source ./dirname/Scripts/activate</code>     
    You know it worked if you terminal changes to the name of the virtual environment

5. At the command line run this command to install all the required libraries. </br>
<code> pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>
