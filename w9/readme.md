# My Python App

## How to setup and run my code

1. Clone my public repo into your local system. 

2. At the command line run this command to install all the required libraries. </br>
<code> pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

3. Optional - if you want to have my libraries installed into a virtual enivornment do that setup work before running the pip install above. 

>> 1.  Create a new virtual environment inside the directory
    <code>python3 -m venv dirname</code>
>> 2. add .gitignore <br>in the dirname and place * in that file to not have any of the files tracked int his folder    
>> 3. Activate virtual enivornment</br>
>> Mac and Linus </br>
    <code>source dirname/bin/activate </code>      
>> Windows </br>
    <code>source ./dirname/Scripts/activate</code>     
    You know it worked if you terminal changes to the name of the virtual environment
>> Now run pip install from above    


## Thanks for running my code
